			<p> I gave you all my lovin'
				Offers I had a dozen
				But I ain't give 'em nothing, never do you like that
				But then I caught you creepin'
				Secrets that you were keepin'
				Like every other weekend, why you do me like that?
				So now you say you take it all back
				Yeah that don't mean jack
				'Cause I know the facts
				I swear you must be smoking that crack
				I'm dippin' so fast
				Yeah, I don't need that
				Now you're running your mouth
				But there's nothing that can slow me down
				You're messing around
				Got me thinking that it's time you go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
				'Cause I'm not listening, no, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
				I see you move your lips but it sounds like gibberish
				(Gibberish)
				I don't need to recover
				Rising way up above you
				Go run and tell your mother "why he do me like that?"
				Good luck…
